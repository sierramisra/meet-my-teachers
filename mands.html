     <h1>About The Professor</h1>
     <p>Dr. Jenn Mackay</p>
     <p>Dr. Mackay graduated from the University of Alabama with a PhD in 2008. She has expressed her passion for passing on her knowledge in journalism and reporting to her students. Dr. Mackay keeps her sunglasses on her head every class, and loves her pets with all her heart.</p>
     <h2>About The Course</h2>
     <p>In Media and Society, we learn about the history of media, and the impact it has had on society through the years. The class is lecture-based, but students discuss issues relevant to the course in groups, and answer in-class questions online. Our grade will be based off of two exam grades and a cumulative final.
</p>
     <h2>My Opinion</h2>
     <p>I look forward to viewing and debating examples of controversial media in this class. In my opinion, the tests are fair and the lectures keep me on my toes.
</p>
<h2>Expected Grade</h2>
<p>I hope to earn an A in this class, as I have not missed any of the participation grades, I scored within the 90-94 range on the first two exams, and I plan to study hard for the final.</p>
