     <h2>About The Course</h2>
     <p>In this class, we discuss the impact that human consumption of fossil fuels has had on history and the negative effects it is having on our planet. We completed a project in which we chose a source of energy we use every day, and describe how energy is used in its production from the very beginning to the end. Other than the “Follow the Energy Project”, our grade is based off a midterm, a final, and a class discussion called the “Energy Summit”, which will be held at the end of the semester.
</p>
     <h2>My Opinion</h2>
     <p>I like this course because it connects history, current events, and scientific facts. I find the in-class discussions interesting, and the graded assignments have been easy, as long as I have paid attention in class and have completed the readings.
</p>
<h2>Expected Grade</h2>
<p>I hope to earn an A in this course, as I did very well on the midterm, have not missed any of the in-class quizzes, and will have a lot of time to study for the final.
