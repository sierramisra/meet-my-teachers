     <h1>About The Professor</h1>
     <p>Linea Cutter</p>
     <p>Professor Cutter is working on earning her PhD here at Virginia Tech. She earned her Masters in political science earlier this year at Florida State University. Her areas of research include international political economy, feminist theory, and critical theory. We can always expect her to arrive to class with a professional attitude, wearing a fun, colorful outfit.
</p>
     <h2>About The Course</h2>
     <p>In this class, we focus on the history of globalization and debate the effect it has had on world politics. We discuss theories of International Relations and International Political Economy. This class has extensive required readings, so it is important to stay on track. We take reading quizzes every few weeks and have to write two papers this semester, in addition to taking the final exam.</p>
     <h2>My Opinion</h2>
     <p>I feel that I have learned a lot from this class through completing the readings. However, I wish there had been more instruction and explanation in class, as the readings took up more time than any other coursework I have ever been assigned in college so far. I do appreciate how completing the group presentation and paper project gave me an extensive understanding of our assigned subject.
</p>
<h2>Expected Grade</h2>
<p>I did well on the first research paper, and have earned satisfactory grades on the reading quizzes and the group project. I expect to earn a good grade on the second paper, but I think the final exam will be difficult. While I feel that I have put more time and effort into this course than any other, I expect to earn a B-.
