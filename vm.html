     <h2>About The Course</h2>
     <p>In Visual Media, we focus on learning the basics of programs important in the communications field, such as InDesign, Photoshop, and Premier. We also are learning the fundamentals of HTML, so we can create a basic website if needed. This is a project-based class where we learn mostly through experience. </p>
     <h2>My Opinion</h2>
     <p>I think this class is helpful because it gives us students hands-on experience using different programs, gives us a creative outlet, and gives us experience working in group settings. I also enjoy this class because we are able to show what we have learned through our work, rather than through exams.
</p>
<h2>Expected Grade</h2>
<p>I hope to earn an A in this class, as I have done well on the projects and other assignments so far.</p>
